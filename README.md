# Context Free Grammar
By Ethan Woollet

This is a simple Context Free Grammar implementation. The primary purpose was to use this for a compiler I am working on, but it should work generally for any other Context Free Grammar related uses.

I have also included two example files `simple_example.cpp` and `compiler_example.cpp`. The first is a very basic example similar to what you might have seen in a textbook about language theory. The second one is a more real world example that can parse a teensy subset of RISC-V assembly code. They can be compiled with the `-std=c++17` flag if you would like to test them out.
